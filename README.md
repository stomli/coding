# Ball Drop Puzzle Game

A Tetris-inspired puzzle game where colored ball pieces fall and stack. Match 3+ balls of the same color to clear them and score points. Features special balls (exploding, painting, blocking) and progressive difficulty across 5 difficulty levels.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Classic Tetris Mechanics:** 8 piece shapes made of colored balls
- **Color Matching:** Match 3+ balls horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- **Cascade System:** Continuous matching after balls drop
- **Special Balls:**
  - 💥 Exploding: Clears 7×7 area when matched
  - 🎨 Painting: Changes entire lines to matched color
  - 🚫 Blocking: Enemy balls that can only be exploded
- **5 Difficulty Levels:** From Easy to Master
- **Progressive Levels:** Unlimited levels with increasing challenge
- **High Score System:** Track best scores per difficulty/level

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- No installation required - runs entirely in browser

### Running the Game

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Select difficulty and level
4. Start playing!

## 🎯 How to Play

### Controls
- **← →** Move piece left/right
- **↑** Rotate piece clockwise
- **↓** Hard drop (instant fall)
- **P** Pause game
- **R** Restart level

### Objective
Survive for 15 seconds per level by matching colored balls. Avoid filling any column to the top!

### Scoring
- **Base:** 1 point per ball cleared
- **Cascades:** Progressive multipliers (Level 1: ×1, Level 2: ×2, Level 3: ×3, etc.)
  - Example: 2× cascade with 3 balls (L1) + 5 balls (L2) = 3 + 10 = 13 points
- **Difficulty:** 1.0×, 1.5×, 2.0×, 2.5×, 3.0× multipliers
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded floating text (white: clears, gold: explosions, blue: cascades)
