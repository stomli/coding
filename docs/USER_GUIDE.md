## How to Play

### Objective
Survive for **90 seconds** without filling any column to the top of the board.

### Basic Gameplay Loop
1. **Falling Pieces:** Colored ball pieces fall from the top (like Tetris)
2. **Stacking:** Position pieces to stack balls at the bottom
3. **Matching:** Match 3+ balls of the same color to clear them
4. **Cascades:** Balls above cleared ones drop down and can create new matches
5. **Survive:** Keep the board clear until the timer reaches 0:00

### Game Over
The game ends if any column fills to the top row when a new piece spawns or locks.

### Level Complete
When the timer reaches 0:00, you complete the level and unlock the next one!

## Game Mechanics

### Piece Shapes
The game features **8 different piece shapes** composed of 4-6 colored balls:

1. **I-Piece:** 4 balls in a straight line (vertical or horizontal)
2. **O-Piece:** 6 balls in a 2×3 rectangle
3. **T-Piece:** 4 balls in T-shape
4. **L-Piece:** 5 balls in L-shape
5. **J-Piece:** 5 balls in reverse L-shape
6. **S-Piece:** 5 balls in S-shape
7. **Z-Piece:** 5 balls in Z-shape
8. **Single Ball:** 1 ball

### Matching Directions
Balls match when 3 or more of the same color align in any of these directions:
- **Horizontal** →
- **Vertical** ↓
- **Diagonal (4 directions)** ↗ ↘ ↙ ↖

### Cascade System
After balls clear, gravity pulls remaining balls down. This can create new matches:
1. Match found → Balls clear
2. Balls above drop down
3. New matches detected → More balls clear
4. Process repeats until no more matches
5. Each cascade level multiplies your score!

### Color Unlocking
As you progress through levels, more colors become available:
- **Levels 1-2:** 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue)
- **Level 3+:** 4 colors (add Yellow)
- **Level 7+:** 5 colors (add Magenta)
- **Level 11+:** 6 colors (add Cyan)
- **Level 15+:** 7 colors (add Orange)
- **Level 19+:** 8 colors (add Purple)

## Scoring System

### Base Scoring
- **1 point per ball cleared** (configurable)
- Applies to all cleared balls (matches, explosions, paintings)

### Cascade Bonuses (Progressive Multipliers)
Cascades are the key to high scores! Each cascade level gets a multiplier:
- **1st cascade:** Balls × 1 (base points)
- **2nd cascade:** Balls × 2 (double points)
- **3rd cascade:** Balls × 3 (triple points)
- **4th+ cascade:** Balls × 4, 5, 6... (keeps increasing!)

**Example:**
```
2x Cascade:
- Level 1: 3 balls × 1 = 3 points
- Level 2: 5 balls × 2 = 10 points
Total: 13 points
```

```
3x Cascade:
- Level 1: 3 balls × 1 = 3 points
- Level 2: 5 balls × 2 = 10 points
- Level 3: 6 balls × 3 = 18 points
Total: 31 points
```

### Difficulty Multipliers
Your final score is multiplied by your difficulty setting:
- **Difficulty 1 (Easy):** ×1.0
- **Difficulty 2:** ×1.5
- **Difficulty 3:** ×2.0
- **Difficulty 4:** ×2.5
- **Difficulty 5 (Master):** ×3.0

**Final Score Formula:**
```
Score = (Total cascade points) × Difficulty multiplier
```

### Visual Feedback
The game shows different colored floating text:
- **White numbers:** Normal match ball counts
- **Gold numbers:** Explosion ball counts
- **Blue text:** Cascade bonuses ("2x CASCADE!", "3x CASCADE!", etc.)

## Tips & Strategies

### Beginner Tips
1. **Use the Ghost Piece:** The transparent outline shows where your piece will land
2. **Plan Vertical Matches:** Easier to set up than horizontal ones
3. **Don't Rush:** Use the lock delay (500ms) to fine-tune placement
4. **Clear Often:** Don't let balls stack too high
5. **Practice Difficulty 1:** Learn the mechanics before increasing difficulty

### Intermediate Strategies
1. **Set Up Cascades:** Place balls to create chain reactions
2. **Save Exploding Balls:** Use them strategically to clear blocking balls
3. **Painter Combos:** Painting can instantly create massive cascades
4. **Manage Colors:** Keep similar colors grouped for easier matching
5. **Center Focus:** Keep the center columns clear for blocking balls

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Cascade Planning:** Visualize 2-3 levels of cascades ahead
2. **Color Distribution:** Balance colors across the board
3. **Explosion Timing:** Wait for blocking balls to cluster before using explosions
4. **Painter Chains:** Paint to create matches that create more matches
5. **Speed Control:** Use hard drop strategically to control cascade timing
6. **Edge Management:** Use walls to control piece rotation and placement

### High Score Strategies
1. **Focus on Cascades:** A single 5x cascade scores more than many 1x clears
2. **Play Higher Difficulties:** The multiplier dramatically increases scores
3. **Delay Clearing:** Sometimes waiting to create bigger cascades is worth it
4. **Special Ball Synergy:** Combine painters and explosions for mega-clears
5. **Survive Longer:** More time = more opportunities for high-scoring cascades
